NOV 2, 7:02 PM

Rocky Figueroa
Ok sounds good, thank you
I‚Äôll read through it

Carlos Fletes
I'll be going through it tomorrow

Rocky Figueroa
I want to know, do you guys want to do something fun like making a video game, or something more serious like a real world application?

Carlos Fletes
Good question, I'll answer that after I look through examples lol.
I would prefer a video game though

NOV 2, 10:45 PM

Matthew Punsalan
When do you guys wanna meet to discuss the project

NOV 4, 3:56 PM

Justen
A video game would be cool, but if it requires animation like basically any video game would, I think it would be really hard
I read over the examples and I think if we were to do something like a school database, kinda like webportal, it would be complex enough to make a project out of but also easy enough to split up between our group
That‚Äôs my thoughts about it, but I‚Äôm open to what everyone else thinks as well

NOV 4, 4:20 PM

Rocky Figueroa
That‚Äôs sounds like a good proposal, it also ties in nicely for the next database class
What info will the data base contain? Like email and red ID?

NOV 4, 5:21 PM

Justen
Ya, so I was thinking we could have a login for admin, who could add students and change their major/redId, and then have a different option to login as a student where the student would use their name and redId to login
And then the student could do stuff like add classes to their schedule and check grades(which could be changed in the admin login)
I haven‚Äôt thought about it too much but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve come up with so far

NOV 5, 2:08 PM

Rocky Figueroa
Ok guys today I‚Äôm going to start the proposal for our project. I‚Äôm going to use Justen‚Äôs idea for the project.

Justen
Maybe make a google doc and put the template on there, then u can add us all I the google doc
My email is navyblue912@gmail.com

Rocky Figueroa
Sounds good. I‚Äôll do that

Justen
Thank you!

Xavier Truong
Mine is xaviertruong2479@gmail.com

NOV 5, 2:48 PM

Rocky Figueroa
Ok I shared you guys on google slides
I will have class in a little while so at around 5:00pm I will get back to working on the proposal.

NOV 5, 3:01 PM

Carlos Fletes

Thanks for starting the proposal, I‚Äôve been really busy today with EE310 stuff, but it‚Äôs due at 6pm tomorrow so I‚Äôll try to find some time to help out with it, if we all do a little bit here and there it shouldn‚Äôt be hard.

NOV 6, 10:41 AM

Carlos Fletes

NOV 6, 2:48 PM

Justen

NOV 6, 4:47 PM

Rocky Figueroa
It‚Äôs cool. Take your time

Xavier Truong
My*

NOV 6, 5:38 PM

Rocky Figueroa
Well I meant the next time we meet up hopefully

Justen
Oh ya for sure

Rocky Figueroa
Guys I think it‚Äôs best we wait until we get feedback on our proposal before we meet up. That way we know for sure we will be working on this.
Let me know what you all think

NOV 6, 5:59 PM

Justen
Sounds good to me

NOV 6, 6:50 PM

Xavier Truong

Carlos Fletes
Do you know how to get us approved into the project github? It says I gotta get push permission

Push permission is just for the repo owner so that code pushes can be reviewed before being pulled by master/branch

Rocky Figueroa

TUE, 3:19 PM

Rocky Figueroa
Thanks Carlos. Check if you can see the code and if your able to change it

TUE, 3:35 PM

Carlos Fletes

TUE, 4:41 PM

Rocky Figueroa
Could you see and change the code?

Carlos Fletes
Yes

TUE, 4:59 PM

Rocky Figueroa
Cool thanks Carlos!

WED, 8:27 PM

Rocky Figueroa
Nice! I‚Äôm going to start on the project soon..

WED, 8:59 PM

Carlos Fletes
Are you guys able to add the sqlitepcl as a reference? It's not in the list to add a reference. I installed it to my project too

WED, 9:11 PM

Carlos Fletes
Well typing it in your code works at least 
Also we can't use the current files uploaded bc they depend on sql. Right?

Rocky Figueroa
I think you can
The files uploaded are regular C# code

12:41 AM

Justen
Wernt y‚Äôall going to add branches to add documentation?, I can‚Äôt see them if u did
Anyways, I guess I can upload our previous documentation stuff tomorrow, but here is that SQLite webpage I found a while back
Use a SQLite database in a UWP app - UWP app developer | Microsoft Docs - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/data-access/sqlite-databases

12:54 AM

Xavier Truong

Could you still access my repository or it still doesn‚Äôt work?

Matthew Punsalan
I already made the new one and added u guys
Just accept the email or view the trello board for the link

Justen
Awesome, thanks Matthew

Xavier Truong
@Rocky Figueroa we could not commit anything to your git so Matthew created a new one

Rocky Figueroa
Ok sorry guys

1:37 PM

Rocky Figueroa
Matthew could you still access my repository?
I say we stick to my repository account so we don‚Äôt get confused

Justen
Nah, I think it would be better just to use matthew‚Äôs it seems like he know how to use it the best

1:50 PM

Rocky Figueroa
Alright I‚Äôll let Amack know we are using Mathews repository then
I already uploaded the video files

Justen
No, he‚Äôll know when we send him our update tonight
U don‚Äôt have to tell him

Matthew Punsalan
I created my branch and the test branch along with a pull request from my changes to the test branch
I didnt make your branches yet because i want yall to make it yourself to better understand whats happening but i'll be there to help
I just made a simple login form theres no functionality

Justen
Ok cool, sounds good
Do we have to accept ur pull request even tho u created it

Matthew Punsalan
Yea technically i can accept it myself but u normally want someone else to accept it
Just to keep people in the loop of what changes are being made and reviewed

Justen
Oh I see

3:01 PM

Xavier Truong
Class is cancelled tonight
